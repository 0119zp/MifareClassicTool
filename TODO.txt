TODO (Maybe outdated):

()   = Just a "todo"  (= LOW in source code)
(+)  = Important      (= TODO in source code)
(++) = Very important (= FIXME in source code)


(++) Send raw ISO 14443A commands.

(++) Change manufacturer block of Magic Chinese Cards
     (if this is possible with raw NfcA commands).

(+)  Write one or more sectors from a dump to a tag.

(+)  Quick read (and dump) tags.
     Choose key files -> Map keys to sectors of the first tag
     -> Remember this key map for the next tags to read them
     as quick as possible -> dump the tags with time stamp.

(+)  Display blanks between hexbytes in the dump editor view
     for better reading.

(+)  Clone tag but use "08778F" as access condition.
     This ACs permit any change with key B. If a reader
     does not check the ACs, this functionality could
     be used to make the RFID-Tag reusable
     (there is no read only block).

(+)  Test Application with Mifare Classic 2k Tags.

()   Create a Access Conditions encode / decode tool.

()   Use XML to save dumps.
     Tagging lines with symbols like "+" is a ugly hack.

()   Import key files from any location on the device.

()   Pass better objects between activities (via intent)
     then a stringblobb separated by new line.
     Each occurrence of this issue is marked in the source code.
     (See http://stackoverflow.com/a/2141166)

()   The key map creator activity should return the key map
     in intent extra.
